# JARVIS AI-Powered Query Assistant

This is an AI-powered query assistant that integrates the **Google Generative AI model** with a **Streamlit frontend** and **Flask backend**. Users can interact with the system by entering a query, and the application generates an AI-based response in real-time.

## Features
- **Frontend** built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- **Backend** powered by Flask, which interacts with the Google Generative AI API.
- **AI Responses** generated by the Gemini model using the Google Generative AI API.
- **Error Handling** with retry logic for smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Generative AI Model**: Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** to handle requests between different ports.
- **Requests Library** for HTTP communication with the Flask API.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Flask (`pip install flask`)
3. Flask-CORS (`pip install flask-cors`)
4. Google Generative AI API (`pip install google-generativeai`)
5. Requests library for making HTTP requests (`pip install requests`)
6. Streamlit (`pip install streamlit`)

## How to Create API Key for Google Generative AI (Gemini)
To use the Google Generative AI API, you need to create an API key. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**:
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on the "Select a Project" dropdown at the top of the page.
   - Click on **New Project** and follow the instructions to create a new project.

3. **Enable the API**:
   - After the project is created, go to the **API & Services** dashboard.
   - Search for **Generative AI** or **Gemini** in the API library.
   - Enable the **Generative AI API** for your project.

4. **Create API Credentials**:
   - In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
   - Click on **Create Credentials** and select **API Key**.
   - Your API key will be generated and shown in a pop-up. Copy this key to use in your project.

5. **Save the API Key**:
   - Create a file named `api.txt` in the root directory of this repository.
   - Paste the copied API key into the `api.txt` file and save it.

## How to Set Up

### Step 1: Set Up the Flask Backend
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Create a file called `api.txt` in the root directory and paste your **Google Generative AI API key** inside this file.
4. Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
   This will start the backend server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Step 2: Set Up the Streamlit Frontend
1. In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
   This will open the frontend at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Step 3: Test the Application
- Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
- Enter a query (e.g., "Explain Logistic Regression") and click **Get Response**.
- The AI-generated response will be displayed below the input box.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a query in the Streamlit UI.
2. The query is sent to the Flask backend via a POST request.
3. The Flask backend processes the request using the Google Generative AI model (Gemini).
4. The response is returned to the Streamlit frontend and displayed in real-time.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the Flask server is running before using the Streamlit interface.
- Make sure the correct API key is placed in the `api.txt` file.
- If connection issues occur, check the Flask server logs for any errors.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more complex AI models and additional functionality.
- Implementing authentication for secure use.
- Improve UI with more interactive features.
